My friend Zack is a great cook and a fantastic dinner host. He shared a recipe with me for this easy olive oil cake. He got the original recipe from Cook's Illustrated, and I adapted it just slightly to use two types of sugar and cook a few extra minutes longer. It's a simple cake, and a good one.

## Ingredients

* 1 ¾ cups White Lily All Purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon Clabber Girl baking powder
* ¾ teaspoon salt
* 3 large eggs
* 1 ¼ cups white granulated sugar like Dixie Crystals
* 2 tablespoons raw sugar like Demerara
* zest from one Meyer lemon
* ¾ cup good, fruity everyday olive oil like [Georgia Olive Farms blend](http://georgiaolivefarms.com/gof/store/) or [California Olive Ranch Everyday Extra Virgin Olive Oil](https://californiaoliveranch.com/olive-oil-101/our-olive-oil/)
* ¾ cup whole milk

## Equipment

* A springform pan, 8 or 9 inches in diameter
* Parchment paper, to line the bottom of the cake pan
* A pat of butter at room temperature, to grease the sides of the cake pan
* Electric mixer, either hand-held or a stand
* A couple of medium-sized mixing bowls, measuring cups, measuring spoons, and a little spatula

## Directions

1. Heat your oven to 350 degrees.
2. Prep your springform pan by laying the parchment paper over the bottom and then locking the springform sides around the base; grease the sides of the springform pan with a bit of butter; set aside.
3. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
4. In a separate mixing bowl, crack the 3 eggs into the bowl and mix on medium until light and foamy.
5. Add the lemon zest and sugar into the bowl with the foamy eggs and mix on high until fluffy.
5. Turn the mixer down to medium and slowly drizzle the olive oil into the eggy sugar mixture, mixing continuously, until no streaks of olive oil are visible.
6. Dump half of the flour mixture into the wet mixture and mix until no white clumps of flour are visible, scraping down the bowl as needed.
7. Pour the milk into the batter and mix on medium; at this point the batter will be wet and splashy. 
8. Dump the rest of the flour mixture into the wet batter and mix until no white clumps of flour are visible.
9. Pour the batter into the prepared springform pan and sprinkle the raw Demerara sugar evenly over the top of the cake batter.
10. Bake for 50 minutes. Cool before serving.

Note: while the cake bakes, it will puff up and create a crispy flying-saucer-like layer that hovers over the cake. This layer will settle as the cake cools.
