The last few weeks have been rough.

Each day seems more violent and mind-numbingly tragic than the day before - and that's just [the stuff on the news](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2014/08/what-all-this-bad-news-is-doing-to-us.html).

When bad things happen, most productive people compartmentalize those things and keep moving. I don't compartmentalize well. Bad things make me feel anxious. When my anxiety goes unchecked I [shut down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb2jGy76v0Y).

This week I'm feeling inspired by mini-habits. ([Thanks for sharing, Nikki!](https://twitter.com/techmarketeratl/status/504325506746294272)) Mini-habits can be a powerful antidote when anxiety is holding you back. The idea is to break daunting goals into small quotas that you can hit easily. If the quotas are small enough you'll exceed them naturally and gain momentum.

Here's what some of my mini-habits looked like this past week:

* **Read and reply to one email.** I knocked out so many emails!
* **Mop one room in my house.** Guess who mopped four rooms?! This gal.
* **Put one foot in front of the other foot.** Made it all the way out the door and up 5 flights of stairs this morning. Not bad at all, [if I do say so myself](http://38.media.tumblr.com/0c7ae7fc59c54ad3bea2f696dbf7ec12/tumblr_myn3szNP3X1qej93ko1_500.gif).

Go forward one step at a time and be amazed at how far you can go.

And if you can't make it that one step, if you can't do that one thing, that's okay! Shutting down can be a beautiful sign that you need to take a break or ask for help. We all need to accept support from time to time. Take care of yourself. You are important.
