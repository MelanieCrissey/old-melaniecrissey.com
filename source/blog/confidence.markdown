Yesterday Tavi Gevinson posted a snippet of text on Instagram:

My reaction: “Whoa. If women only feel confident when they’re practically perfect, most women must _never_ feel truly confident. Maybe Mary Poppins. The rest of us are doomed.”

<p>Tavi’s caption: “This is why I start every morning with M.I.A <img class="emoji" alt="gold start" src="/img/gold-star.png"/></p>

(Excuse me while I add all the M.I.A. songs to my _[Do Work](http://open.spotify.com/user/1216657104/playlist/3gB0VbAyNg02B62tLw8pyE)_ playlist.)

The pictured excerpt is a bit of an article titled _[The Confidence Gap](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/04/the-confidence-gap/359815/)_ that was published in The Atlantic last month. Key takeaways:

* **Don't fake confidence.** People react positively to genuine overconfidence and negatively to insincere displays of confidence.
* **Don't seek perfection.** Perfectionism breeds inaction. I quote Queen Bey, “Perfection is a disease of a nation.”
* **Don't blame yourself.** External attribution (“That test was hard!”) makes us resilient, while internal attribution (“I’m so bad at taking tests.”) holds us back.
* **Ladies: Speak less.** Both men and women perceive female [volubility](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/volubility) as a sign of weakness, while expecting successful men to speak more.
* **Do more.** We build genuine confidence through successes and failures. Stop overthinking things and just do something.

“Speak less” is challenging advice. It's also the last thing you want to hear when you’ve finally worked up the courage to do something… _like_… _I don’t know_… **start blogging.**

Henceforth I pledge brevity. Here’s to making every word count.

Cheers, y'all!
