Wowza. It's been a minute. 

In no particular order, here's a partial list of things wonderful that have happened in my life since I last wrote a blog post here:

* Saw the team at [Rigor double revenue in less than 8 months](https://www.instagram.com/p/9JenbNyUdd/)
* [Adopted a puppy](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/piperthehyperpupper/) (who has since officially reached 'spoiled doggo' status)
* Ran my [first ever 5K](https://www.instagram.com/p/BC3IdUMyUdB/)
* Overcame a number of personal struggles and tragedies
* Practiced yoga for more than 152 hours
* Published two short stories [reviewing the annual "box drop" in my hometown](https://medium.com/stay-shiny-marietta)
* Joined the [U40 Kiwanis Club in Marietta](https://www.facebook.com/kiwanisu40marietta/)
* Helped organize more than 200 volunteers for a [historic home tour](http://www.mariettapilgrimage.com/)
* Taught a crash course in web performance to a group of [WIT Girls](http://rigor.com/blog/2016/11/wit-girls)
* Participated in a [48in48 weekend](https://48in48.org/) in Atlanta
* Took an actual, unplugged-from-work vacation with my husband
* [Marched on Washington](https://www.instagram.com/p/BPi-BS8hv8S/)
* Sang on stage with groups of friends at two hootenannies
* Wrote more than 6,000 words about [what you learn working with early-stage SaaS startups](https://medium.com/@MelanieCrissey/what-you-learn-working-in-early-stage-saas-startups-b2250a07211f)
* Traveled to Los Angeles, New York, Palm Springs, and Philadelphia for fun work things
* Accepted an opportunity to work with [FullStory](https://fullstory.com/love) (still pinching myself over this one)

One thing I didn't do:

* Finish my 90DaysofUX project

<h3>90 Days of UX</h3>

The [original plan](/blog/90daysofux) was to work through a syllabus of specific topics and write one post a day for 90 Days. Y'all. I only made it two weeks.

Nevertheless! I'm a big fan of picking things up where they were left off, and I've never been one to fret over a change of plans.

Furthermore, some things have changed since I first started dabbling in UX learning. People across industries are embracing user experience principles and rolling them into their customer relationship management strategies. As more companies seek to deliver exceptional experiences for their customers through multiple channels and interfaces, [search terms show a trend](https://blog.fullstory.com/why-is-customer-experience-so-important-word-of-mouth-7d5c12d55153) of interest in "customer experience" or "CX."

CX is nothing new. Companies have been executing and benefiting from customer experience design for as long as businesses have been [taking people's money](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/be/17/0f/be170f3e4a98117aa32357683c30865d.gif). But, as more aspects of customer experience depend on interactions with web or native interfaces that rely on thoughtful user experience design, the lines between UX and CX are getting fuzzy. I'm interested in learning more about the intersection of UX and CX.

New idea: finish that 90 Days of UX as 76 Days of CX with less rules on the table this time.

Desired outcome: learn some new things and show my work.

<h3>76 Days of CX</h3>
New rules:

* From now until 8 July 2017 (which is 76 days from today)
* Some number of short blog posts about customer experience topics
* Delivered on no specific schedule

That, my friends, is how to commit to _not_ overcommitting. 

Now, onward!
