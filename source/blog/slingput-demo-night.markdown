Last night we celebrated the end of [Startup x Month](http://www.hypepotamus.com/community/startup-x-month-grand-finale/) and the launch of [Slingput](http://www.slingput.com/) with a walking tour of the neighborhood [Switchyards](http://www.switchyards.com/) will call home.

### ICYMI

Brave souls conquered weather and traffic to meet in the thoroughfare of Williams Street, between 151 and 161 Spring, for what felt something akin to a huddle. The play? Build a design-led community in this [Fairlie-Poplar Historic District](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairlie-Poplar,_Atlanta) where some of Atlanta's best old buildings stand in proximity.

I looked upon the building. I saw what it could become. Imagine floor to ceiling windows on the street-level, light flooding into an open community space... 

There's a decaying mural on the side of the building. *Who painted it? Can it be salvaged? Will we remember that it was there?*

We splashed across Spring street and paraded to Park Bar passing this beautiful [Hense](http://hensethename.com/) mural on the way.

Upstairs humidified travelers met folks well into their first round. When it seemed that no one else could fit into the room, Tavani delivered a presentation. Key takeaways:

* **[Tavani](https://twitter.com/tavani)** has mad skills with Keynote for Mac
* **Slingput** helps you get your idea from early conception to the next step - whether that's crowdfunding, quitting your day job, or just taking the time to make it happen
* **Switchyards** has a Slingput page now: [switchyards.slingput.com](http://switchyards.slingput.com)

As I did laps around the bar with my pint of [Drafty Kilt](http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/26516/71870/), awkwardly piping into tight circles of conversation, I confirmed my suspicion that Switchyards, like [the Village](http://atlantatechvillage.com/), isn't about the building. Switchyards is about people - founders, doers, idealists - on a mission to make great things.

### Thoughts on the launch

Today I woke up regretting that last night I didn't personally thank every member of the Slingput crew for their work. We're up there in the numbers for a group of co-founders. Together there are 10 of us - and that doesn't include the mentors Tavani brought in to help guide the project.

Every person who participated in this Slingput Startup x Month pulled weight so that we could launch with a strong brand and a working product.

**These are the good folks who made Slingput happen:**

I'm grateful that I had a chance to work with these talented folks for a month. I can't wait to see what we built next.
