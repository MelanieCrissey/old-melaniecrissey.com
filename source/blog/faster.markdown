Warning: strong opinions ahead. 

###If you're not ready to do the work to make your website load faster, don't bother monitoring it for performance.

Sure. Set up some basic availability alerts so that you can wake up if your site goes down in the middle of the night. Invest in some load testing so that you'll know your site can handle the traffic just in case you go viral.

But, seriously. If you're not planning to do something about the perceived speed of you website, why do you care how fast your website renders or loads? How much are you paying to capture a metric that you have no plans to move?

Your baseline doesn't matter if you're not going to try to hold the line or do better. Your industry benchmark doesn't matter if everyone in your industry is comfortable using the same bloated, laggy platform.

Web performance isn't a race. It's not enough to be a little bit faster than the next person. You're only winning if you're never getting slower. Web performance is a competition against the best version of your self. You have to always be improving.

##Web Performance Directly Affects User Experience

The speed and reliability of your website affects the user experience that you're delivering. And, the sheer weight of your website - in terms of the data that you require your end-users to consume - passes real life costs along to your end-users, especially if your website serves anyone in the x% of the world that's operating on a less than 3G network as their primary mode of internet access.

Even if 80% of your core users are on Desktop on a good network, it's important to consider the opportunity of delivering a great experience to the users who aren't.

###An example of great mobile #webperf in the wild

Today I left my house to go meet a friend for coffee. Before I got out of my neighborhood, I encountered an incredibly cute and obviously well-loved dog who was roaming human-free along the sidewalk. Tried as I might, I couldn't coax the sly little puppernugget to jump into my car. And, not wanting to be late for my meeting, I didn't necessarily have time to park and put on a chase.

So, I took out my phone, hopped on Nextdoor.com, logged in, and quickly posted an alert with the description and location of the pup.

The whole process took about 6 seconds, and I was back en route to my coffee meeting.

By the time that I landed at the coffee shop, pulled out my laptop, connected to wi-fi, and re-visited the thread, a neighbor had posted to confirm that the little dog was safe. It had hardly wandered out of its own yard.

Even if the sweet little doggo was never in any real danger, the Nextdoor app did the job it was supposed to do because it allowed me to quickly and conveniently share urgent information with my neighbors.

When things feel urgent, speed matters. If the Nextdoor app hadn't loaded quickly from my phone, how would that have affected my experience? How might that slowness have affected my willingess to recommend the app to a friend?


##Web Performance Directly Affects Customer Experience

As end-users, we all benefit when applications load quickly. But, as businesses who generate revenue online, our bottom line hinges on performance.

Whether you sell ad views or mattresses, fidget spinners or professional services, your customers who visit your web properties expect them to render quickly on mobile and desktop. The difference in 100 ms of load time could mean the difference between selling more product or losing impatient shoppers to competitors who are only a Google Search away.

##Learning Where to Take Action

Every once in a while, I run a free Rigor Optimization scan on my personal blog here. Today I was disappointed to see that my performance was a bit off.
