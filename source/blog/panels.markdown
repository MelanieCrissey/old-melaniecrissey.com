Today I went to two panels at SuperNova South:

* *How things go wrong when UX professionals fall in love with just one UX technique*
* *Women in UX*

Some things I learned:

* [uxmentors.com](http://uxmentors.com/) exists
* [usertesting.com](https://www.usertesting.com/) exists
* "popcorn testing" describes a method of testing a prototype with customers in the wild, ambush-style in a short window of time
* how we design a test may threaten the integrity of our results

I was pretty intrigued by the mention of [usertesting.com](https://www.usertesting.com/), so I took some time tonight to give a try.

### Creating a user test

I filled out a simple text input field for a website URL to test and clicked a button that said 'Get a free, 5 minute video.'

This directed me to a landing page form for a free trial account. I sent them my name, work email, a phone number (555-555-5555, because please don't call me), and a password for the trial account.

Within an hour I received an email with a link to initial test results that included:

* a 5-minute video with audio of a test user's initial impressions of and interactions with the site
* answers to some survey questions (scale of 1-10) about impressions, difficulty, and whether or not the test user would recommend this site to a friend
* some basic information about the test user's demographics and technical systems

The test user expressed some frustrations with the site:

* too much content, too wordy
* hard to figure out what the company did or what they offered

and some favorable reactions:

* they liked the ever-present 'start trial' call-to-action buttons
* they liked the company logos for social-proof on the homepage

While the frustrations echoed my own concerns about the site, the test user reacted favorably to two features that I personally find a bit salesy or off-putting. **#youarenotyouruser.com**

Seeing the initial results from this test got my brain spinning thinking about how much more valuable this type of service for research could be with more results from a targeted set of test users answering a more focused set of questions.
