Whoops! I got off track and now I'm a little behind schedule.

### Some things I've done since my last #90DaysofUX post:

* Went to General Assembly at Ponce City Market for Team Rigor's quarterly all hands meeting
* Saw *The Martian* with my favorite movie buddy
* Slept in on a rainy Saturday
* Took a huge carton of garments to Goodwill
* Tried on way too many plaid flannel shirts at Goodwill
* Practiced so many side planks at hot yoga
* Participated in a UX survey for my friend's homework
* Created a survey form for a new navigation user interface that's going live soon
* Read [this stellar UX Myths post](http://uxmyths.com/post/647473628/myth-people-read-on-the-web) about how people read websites (THANK YOU, Roberta, for sharing this with me!)
* Read the first two chapters of [*Rethinking UX*](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/smashing-ebook-rethinking-ux)

### Applying this concept

Whether we're leading user training or usability testing it's important to leave some time for people to get a little bit off track. Naturally, we'll want to direct attention back to the task at hand and it's desirable to be conscious of time, but when we control behavior we forfeit valuable insights about inclinations and expectations.

We should play some tug of war between scripts and exploration, and give ourselves room to discover experiences.
