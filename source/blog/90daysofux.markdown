Today I'm beginning something new.

**Here's the deal:**

I want to learn UX. I want to research, design, develop, and create accessible products and interactions that help people solve problems. I want to build a portfolio to demonstrate my skills. And, I want to show my work as I learn.

This isn't a new interest or something I'm picking up on a whim. I've been dabbling in UX - [a workshop here](http://www.ladiesthatux.com/benefits-of-collaborative-design/), a wireframe there - for over two years without much to show for myself.

I know that practicing UX as a discipline will make me a better contributor where I work, and help me build a stronger foundation for future projects.

**Here's how I'm going to do it:**

- I will commit an hour each day for 90 days to learn and to practice.

- I will write a syllabus, gather resources, and create assignments for myself.

- I will solicit peers and mentors to critique my work.

- I will write daily blog posts to document my learning experience.

Right now I'm pretty terrified because I'm not 100% sure if I can do this. I have a tendency to get excited and then distracted, to work on things in fits and starts. I've never been a particularly self-disciplined human.

I'm also feeling guilty. I have plenty of unfinished tasks and neglected projects that also need time and attention, all worthy excuses to avoid such an undertaking. But, there's always going to be more work to do than hours in the day. Maybe this will motivate me to knock out some of those pesky to-do items I've been avoiding.

Consider this an invitation to learn with me or hold me accountable.

Here we go. 90 days. 90 hours. 90 little blog posts.

Here's lookin' at you, December 22nd.
