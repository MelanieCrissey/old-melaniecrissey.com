Today marks one year since I took the plunge into my latest dream job working in "Product Marketing" at FullStory.

Here's the photo from [my Instagram snap](https://www.instagram.com/p/BQeKJ-1BtJe/) from exactly one year ago today:

In this moment, one year later, I am feeling (in this order):

* Humbled
* Grateful
* Excited
* Motivated
* Proud, and 
* A tiny bit scared

##Humbled

That I get to work with a bright and beautiful group of empathetic, genius humans who trust me to operate in their world and treat their customers with respect. 

##Grateful

That I've had the chance to stretch my figurative wings, learn new things (command line tools, y'all!), and get involved _at the table_ in countless projects and initiatives that are technically well outside the scope of my job title. 

##Excited

Because I'm looking at our company's vision and objectives for 2018, and we're rowing full speed ahead together in a direction that I'm thrilled to be rowing.

##Motivated

Because while there's been **so much growth**, I know I'm going to have to step up my game and rely on other people to keep up without dropping the balls that I can't afford to break.

##Proud

Because there's still a living, breathing part of me that feels what it was like to wake up at 5:30 in the morning to roll a wagon full of milk cartons, coffee beans, syrup, and pastries across several blocks outside and through a courthouse security checkpoint to set up a coffee kiosk and get quarters thrown or rolled at my feet by government employees who would ask, "When are you going back to school?" to which I'd always reply, "I have a degree in business from a University" and then take home less than minimum wage; 

A part of me that remembers what it was like to mop and scrub tile in a sandwich shop bathroom before driving my co-worker home at 3:30 in the morning and then showing up for Biochem the next morning; 

A part of me that remembers what it was like to feel like I'd never be enough to make a difference; 

A part of me that thought "I'll never find a way to make a living where I can truly be myself"; 

A part of me that thought "Why bother, even?"; 

And, yet... somehow... I am also here.

HERE.

I am proud that I've made decisions that let me do more with my career than my younger self ever imagined possible. And, I'm proud that I still recognize how *lucky* I am to have had each and every opportunity that I took.

I am proud that I've stood on stages and delivered talks (talks!) about topics that I care about in front of crowds of strangers that I perceive to be much smarter and more qualified than I am.

I am proud that I've been able to be a small and mighty advocate for FullStory customers. 

I am proud that I'm still learning, adapting to things that I couldn't see coming, and showing up every day. 

##A tiny bit scared

Because exponential growth means change and uncertainty.

I used to think being "scared" was a bad thing, but an old friend at Rigor — this one's for Marisa, _wherever you are_ — taught me that it's prudent to "Stay scared." It means that you gotta keep your eyes open, stay hungry, and never settle. 

Not that I'd call this "settling."

Thank you, FullStory, for letting me be myself in your confines.

Now, as the FullStorians say, "To the future!"
