2017, y'all. Woof. 

Reflecting on this past year has me feeling dazed. Lots of icky things happened. The news was sad and terrible and relentless. At a personal level, I managed to get in a wreck with a tow truck (fun times) and when it came to work targets, I definitely missed as many as I hit.

But, there were also so many good things. Here are some of those good things:

<ol>
<li>Started one new fulfilling and challenging job (<a href="https://www.fullstory.com/jobs/">get in on this magic</a>; we have La Croix <i>and</i> coupe glasses of peebz.)
  <br/>

</li>

<li>Sang on stage with friends at two hootenannies
<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>Delivered three professional talks at conferences and meetups (plus: spoke on two panels and moderated one!)
<br/>
<br/></li>
<li>Carried signs in four protests
<br/>
<br/></li>
<li>Treated my husband and family members to five sensational dinners at <a href="http://www.springmarietta.com/">my favorite little restaurant on the Marietta Square</a>
<br/>
<br/></li>
<li>Baked and gifted six <a href="/recipes/olive-oil-cake">olive oil cakes</a>
<br/>
<br/></li>
<li>Completed the 7th season of <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70158329">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a>
  <br/>

<br/>
<br/></li>
<li> After 4 years of marriage, finally went to the DMV and got my driver’s license changed to read my married name (shout out to Georgia Department of Driver Services on County Services Rd; y'all were impressively friendly and efficient; 10/10 would visit again) <br/>
<br/></li>
</ol>

Still, this is such an arbitrary list. There were countless moments of celebration: happy hours with new friends, weekends away to visit old friends, new skills learned, new milestones marked, weddings and alpacas and inches of snow...

Look, I'm not making any resolutions this year. Every time I make a list of bad habits to drop, I only end up falling into them harder. But, I will aim to manifest an even longer list of triumphs to enumerate for this time next year.

Keep a count — not only of your blessings — but of all the joy you create for yourself.
