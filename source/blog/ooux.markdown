Yesterday I read [Sophia's post on A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/article/object-oriented-ux) about object-oriented user experience (OOUX). Today I'm practicing this with one of my passion projects that crashed and burned last year.

###Brief

Give residents and business owners in my city a hyperlocal outlet to share stories, promote events, and advertise businesses by neighborhood.

* Readers can search stories and events by neighborhood.
* Business owners can sponsor stories or host events.


###Identifying Objects

* We will share **stories**, **events**, and **businesses**.
* Residents are **readers**, and some residents may also be **writers**.
* Readers will search stories, events, and businesses by **neighborhood**.


###Post-it Note Party

I start with six sticky notes: reader, writer, business, neighborhood, story, and event.

As I begin listing out core content and metadata for each object I decide to ditch the 'reader' object because I won't need individual pages or profiles for every reader yet. This isn't Facebook.

I mentally distinguish that a location is an address that exists within a neighborhood. I also note that while stories and events both have dates, they're different types of dates: a publish date and an event date.

When I finally start to nest and prioritize objects I remember Sophia's pro-tip, "This ordered list does not necessarily provide a direct representation of what will be at the top and the bottom of the screen."

For stories I imagine an image could be much larger than the title, but maybe less important than the date - assuming readers will want to sort stories by recency. For businesses I prioritize hours and location above descriptions or logos, because if I search for a store I want to know if it's open after 6:00 PM, and if I search for a restaurant I want to know if it's open on Sunday for brunch. And, as I'm typing this I'm remembering that *I'm not the reader*, so I should probably do some research to test my hypothesis about hours and locations.
